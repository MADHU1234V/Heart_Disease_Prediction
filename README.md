# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle parameters. The main goal is to help in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare by analyzing patient data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results and feature importance

  ## Dataset
The dataset used includes medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, to predict the presence of heart disease.
